# Wine-Quality-Prediction
In this project I have used random forest classifier for predicting the quality of wine on the basis of the rating. It classifies as either good if rating is greater than 7 or a bad wine. It uses data preprocessing techniques like standard scaler for scalling and dropping the unwanted columns. The model has acheived an accuracy of 92.81%.
